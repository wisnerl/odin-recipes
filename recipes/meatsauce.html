    <p>This is a classic dish in my family. The sauce can be made completely from scratch to be authentic, but it is still very good with a store bought sauce</p>

        <li>Linguine</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>Ground Meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water and when ready, add the Linguine to the the pot</li>
        <li>Cook up the meat in a large sauce pan (can optionally add garlic and onions with the meat)</li>
        <li>When everything is cooked, add the sauce to the pan and let simmer until the pasta is ready</li>
        <li>When the pasta is ready, strain the water out and then add the noodles to the pan</li>
        <li>Stir to incorporate the noodles and the sauce</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
